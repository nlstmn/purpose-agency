                        Online reviews are feedback written by customers about a company, product, or service.
                        These reviews can come on the company's social media page, product page or website. They're
                        used as an opinionated guide for other customers looking for the same products or services.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Reviews can be positive, negative, or neutral. However you want to frame them, the
                        important thing to remember is that they have a purpose: they inform potential buyers so
                        they can make informed decisions before making purchases on their behalf (or recommending those purchases).

                        When looking at potential customers' experiences with your business, you want to see what they say about the quality of your products and services.
                        While there are a lot of other
                        factors that affect how people review your business—including price and location—you can't ignore the importance of
                        what people think of your products or services.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The most important thing that online customer reviews can do is tell you which parts of your service need
                        improvement to meet customers' expectations better.
                        Let's look at 5 reasons online reviews are essential for businesses and websites.

                      <div

                        Reviews can be used as inspiration for product and service improvements. For example, if someone is
                        unhappy with their experience with your product or services, they may leave
                        a review that points out the issues in detail—and then offer suggestions on how those issues could be fixed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This feedback is invaluable as it provides insight into what other customers think about the quality of your goods or services.

                      <p>
                        Users and buyers often search for a product on Google, Facebook, or other websites. Reviews on your website,
                        social media platforms, and other places online can help you get more visibility in search engine results.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Consumers often look for reviews before making a purchase decision, and if they find positive feedback about
                        your product or service, they’re more likely to trust it and buy from you.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Builds Trust And Confidence From Consumers</h4>
                      <div

                      <p>
                        There is no better way to build trust with potential customers than a positive review from your online customers.
                        If your customers have had a positive experience with your business, they’re more likely to recommend it to others.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Suppose you can get positive customer feedback on your website or social media platforms. In that case, it will help build trust with new potential
                        customers looking for information before deciding where to buy.

                      <p>
                        As a business, the ultimate aim is to increase sales. Without sales,
                        you will not be able to make money—the more people who come through your site and convert into buyers, the better for your business.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Customer reviews play an integral role in this process by providing customers with information about what products
                        or services your company offers and how those products and services perform in the real world.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to a study, customers are willing to pay over 20% more if the business has a good reputation.
                        And one thing that positive customer reviews give to your business is a good reputation.

                        Consumer reviews are a great way to determine how a business operates and what customers think. Customers can read through reviews and decide whether or not they want to use the business in question.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Studies have proved that products with reviews are more likely to make sales than those without.
                        And the fact that 90% of consumers read at least one review before visiting a business tells how reviews are essential to businesses.

                      <div
                        className="ptf-spacer"
                        style={{
                          "--ptf-xxl": "1.875rem",
                          "--ptf-md": "1.5625rem",
                        }}
                      ></div>
                      <p>
                        There are several reasons why online reviews are more likely to be read, shared, and liked than traditional ones. For starters, there is a higher chance of seeing an online review if published on sites like TripAdvisor or
                        Yelp because these sites have strong brand recognition and high traffic volume.
                        So, reaching third-party sites (Google, Bing, Facebook) would be more effective.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Also, you can reach a larger audience because most third-party sites allow businesses to create accounts linked to their website or social media
                        profiles. This way, customers who see your reviews on sites like Google, TripAdvisor, or Yelp can easily find your business.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In addition to being more visible than broadcast media outlets, these sites can reach a bigger audience at no cost.
                      </p>
